# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
import sys
import os

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another
# directory, add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is
# relative to the documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it
# absolute, like shown here.
#sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))

# Get the project root dir, which is the parent dir of this
cwd = os.getcwd()
project_root = os.path.dirname(cwd)

# Run apidoc to traverse the project directory and add all modules to the docs
import sphinx.apidoc

sphinx.apidoc.main(argv=['-f', '-o', os.path.join(project_root, 'docs'),
                             os.path.join(project_root, '''outpost24hiabclient''')])

# Insert the project root dir as the first element in the PYTHONPATH.
# This lets us ensure that the source package is imported, and that its
# version is used.
sys.path.insert(0, project_root)

import outpost24hiabclient


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = 'outpost24hiabclient'
copyright = '2020, Theodoor Scholte'

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.viewcode',

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = 'alabaster'

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
